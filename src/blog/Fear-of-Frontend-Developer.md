I slept for a night just for a few hours and when I woke up there is a new JavaScript framework born. The irony is there are many new framework and library coming out who I don’t know about. I don’t know how much I need to upgrade my self. I hope all the web developer interview should focus on basics. But this is not the perfect world. Some company wants a angular guy, who know how to code in angular, that's it.

I am a simple web developer in India, by far I have not contributed enough to any open source, not a consistent member of any community. Looks like there is a lot to learn. But what would you do, if your syllabus is increasing day by day. That’s the fear I am talking about. What I did til now is follow some good people on twitter, completed my Front End Certificate in FreeCodeCamp(which I am proud of, almost 10000 hrs of coding), created a blog where I put my day to day learning(jforjs.com), few videos in Youtube. I know, I know. This is not enough.

One thing I like about this fearful life is that I am on the continuous learning path. I started loving JavaScript. I got respect for other programming languages too. I came to know, every warrior in this battle has some skills, which I can learn from them. Some of those warriors are React Ninjas, some are JS Gurus and some are new bees with amazing learning skills. Isn’t this amazing. We have new level from Functional Programming to Dyanamic Programming, IOT to Machine Learning, and hell I know what is there more to learn.

I am glad that I choose this path, and its great to be fearful. It has more pros than cons. Find this article in <a title="Fear of a Web Developer" href="https://medium.com/@bhupendrasparihar/fear-of-a-web-developer-f009ff613d8b" target="_blank">medium</a>
